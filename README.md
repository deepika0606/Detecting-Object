For object detection using an IR sensor, the system consists of an IR transmitter that emits infrared light and an IR receiver that detects the reflected light. When an object is near, the sensor detects the reflection and sends a signal to a microcontroller like Arduino or ESP32. The detection output can be used to trigger various actions, such as turning on an LED or buzzer, displaying the status on an LCD screen, or controlling a servo motor for automation. The sensor's output pin is connected to a digital pin on the microcontroller, and the system continuously reads the sensor data to check for object presence. If integrated with IoT (ESP32/NodeMCU), detection alerts can be sent to a web dashboard or mobile app. This technology is widely used in automatic doors, obstacle avoidance robots, parking sensors, industrial automation, and security alarms.
